                <p>
                    DARLING in the FRANXX (ダーリン・イン・ザ・フランキス, Darin in za Furankisu) is
                    a 2018 science fiction/mecha anime co-produced by Studio TRIGGER and A-1 Pictures.
                    The series was announced at Trigger's Anime Expo 2017 panel in July 2017.
                    In a post-apocalyptic future, young pilots fight against giant monsters known as
                    klaxosaurs using giant feminine robots known as FRANXX. Their identities are defined
                    solely by their role as pilots, with no personal freedom or knowledge of the outside
                    world beyond the "birdcage" of Mistilteinn or the mobile fortress of Plantation.
                    When former prodigy Hiro becomes unable to pilot a FRANXX, he becomes filled with
                    doubt and conflict about his own worth. That doubt and conflict changes to resolve
                    when he meets a strange part-klaxosaur girl with horns on her head called Zero Two.
                    Despite the risks of teaming up with a known "partner killer," Hiro becomes Zero
                    Two's DARLING to fly a FRANXX again.</p><br>

                        <p>Hiro (ヒロ, Hiro) had an average build, height, and a standard "slim"
                            male physique. He had black, shaggy hair and rich blue eyes.
                            His checkered past had left him with an emphatic expression on his face.
                            He was often seen in the standard Stamen Parasite uniform.</p><br>
                        <p>Over the time spent together he began to reproduce feelings of
                            romance with Zero Two, and when their relationship as partners
                            began to take a turn and slowly crumble, he reawakened his
                            previous feelings during childhood with her, along with his
                            current feelings of love.</p>
                        <p><br> The two eventually began a
                            relationship together before their demise. Although motivated
                            to fulfil his duty as a parasite, he later makes it his purpose
                            in life to free all the parasites from APE’s control and he
                            selflessly sacrifices his own life to protect his friends
                            and the planet.</p><br>
                        <p>A thousand years later, Hiro and Zero Two's souls reincarnate
                            as a pair of children that meet each other again and rekindle
                            their romance.</p>

                        <p>Zero Two (ゼロツー, Zero Tsū) was a human-klaxo sapiens hybrid and a
                            member of the APE Special Force fighting on the front lines. An elite
                            Parasite with the codename "002" who was also known as the
                            "Partner Killer", Zero Two had always accepted solitude due to her
                            horns and Klaxosaur blood. Despite having no regard for human life
                            or her own and being used to fight alone, she took an interest in
                            Hiro and decided to give him a chance to pilot with her, making him
                            her new partner and "darling". After Hiro was able to ride with her
                            more than three times, the pair became the 13th Plantation's newest m
                            embers, piloting a FRANXX called Strelizia.</p><br>
                        <p>Over the time spent together, Zero Two came to develop special
                            feelings towards Hiro, but her determination to become human
                            coupled with Hiro's apparent fear of her increasingly feral
                            characteristics made her begin seeing him as nothing more than
                            an outlet to become human. When their relationship as partners
                            began to take a turn and slowly crumble, she remembered her
                            forgotten feelings of love towards Hiro during childhood along
                            with her current feelings. The two eventually became a couple
                            and chose to sacrifice their own lives in order to protect t
