        <p>I thought that it would be fun if I could recreate one of my past projects from university, and here it
            is.</p><br>
        <p>One of my big passions is anime and the anime world, hence why I made this site. I also enjoy fan art and I
            thought that it would be cool to feature some great artwork in theme with the showed animes.</p><br>
        <p>The site features a catalog of selected high rated anime series, full indepth documentary about every single anime,
        and some very nice fanart. Enjoy :)</p>
