    <h1>What got me inspired</h1>
    <p>
I thought that it would be fun if I could recreate one of my past projects from university, and here it is.</p>
    <p>One of my big passions is anime and the anime world, hence why I made this site. I also enjoy fan art so I
        thought that it would be cool to add some great artwork in theme with the showed animes.</p>
